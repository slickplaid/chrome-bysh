Google Chrome Plugin for Bytesized-hosting.com
==============================================

Keeps track of your box's quota. At the moment, that's about all it does.

## Requirements

- Chrome Browser with an internet connection
- A Bytesized-hosting.com account
- An API key, generated in your account control panel

## Where to get it?

Right now, the plugin is in closed beta but it should be released in the next couple days.

## Future Plans

We're going to be adding new features to the plugin.

Here are some of our ideas:

- Display some of the news events
- Show open tickets
- Respond to open tickets
- Track other usage on your box
- Poll faster when you're looking at your usage, slower when you're not

If you have any ideas that you would like to see in the plugin, please let us know.
We're open to suggestions. :)
